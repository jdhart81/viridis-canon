  The Wu Wei Dominance Theorem  —  Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization
  Viridis LLC.  For submission to Aristotle.
===============================================================================

WHAT IS PROVEN (completely, no `sorry`, no axioms beyond Mathlib):

  Model an ecosystem (or a belief / value distribution) as an abundance vector.
  Management is a *multiplicative drift* (replicator / Bayesian / selection
  update) followed by an *extinction cull* that removes any type below the
  one-individual threshold `thr = 1/N`.

  1. ABSORBING BOUNDARY.  Drift cannot resurrect an extinct type, and the cull
     only removes types: `support (Step c) ⊆ support c`.  (Extinction = Bayes
     assigning probability 0 = irreversible.)
  2. PERMANENCE.  Support — hence species richness — is antitone along any
     trajectory.  Loss is forever.
  3. SUB-CRITICAL SAFETY.  If every step keeps each extant type's drifted
     abundance at or above `thr`, the support is preserved.
  4. SUPER-CRITICAL COLLAPSE.  If at some step the drift pushes an extant type
     below `thr`, that type goes extinct and richness strictly, permanently drops.
  5. DOMINANCE.  A sub-critical (slow / wu wei) policy attains strictly greater
     long-run species richness than a super-critical (aggressive) policy.
     Richness is the Hill-0 diversity index and the ceiling on Shannon diversity
     (max entropy on a k-type support is log k), so this is genuine diversity
     dominance.

THE HONEST BOUNDARY (the input, NOT formalized here):

  WHICH rate regime a policy falls in — i.e. whether hypotheses `hsub`
  (sub-critical) or `hsuper` (super-critical) hold for a given intervention rate
  `r_int` relative to the ecosystem's intrinsic rate `r_eco` — is governed by a
  Kramers / Freidlin–Wentzell escape law:  the mean first-passage time of the
  selection-balanced Wright–Fisher process to the absorbing boundary obeys
  `MFPT ≍ exp(ΔU(r_eco − r_int) / σ²)`, with a critical rate `r* = Θ(r_eco)`
  (empirically ≈ 0.85·r_eco; see `analysis_kramers.py`).  Mathlib lacks
  Freidlin–Wentzell, so that law is supplied as the hypotheses `hsub`/`hsuper`
  below.  This file proves everything downstream of it.

  Tested against a recent Mathlib.  A few lemma names in Mathlib drift between
  releases; the three most likely to need a local rename are flagged inline.

/-! ### The Wu Wei Dominance Theorem -/

/-- **Wu Wei Dominance (bare form).** A policy whose support strictly collapses
    is strictly diversity-dominated by one that preserves the support. -/
theorem wu_wei_dominance
    (Dslow Dfast : Drift n) (thr : ℝ) (c₀ : Abund n) (T : ℕ)
    (hslow : support (evolve Dslow thr T c₀) = support c₀)
    (hfast : support (evolve Dfast thr T c₀) ⊂ support c₀) :
    richness (evolve Dfast thr T c₀) < richness (evolve Dslow thr T c₀) := by
  unfold richness
  rw [hslow]
  exact Finset.card_lt_card hfast

/-- **Wu Wei Dominance (assembled from rate regimes).**
    A sub-critical slow policy and a super-critical fast policy together yield
    strict, permanent species-richness dominance for the slow policy.

    The hypotheses `hsub` (sub-critical) and `hsuper` (super-critical) are the
    interface to the Kramers / Freidlin–Wentzell escape law: `hsub` holds when
    `r_int < r* = Θ(r_eco)`, and `hsuper` holds when `r_int > r*`.  That law is
    the one analytic input not formalized here. -/
theorem wu_wei_dominance_of_rates
    (Dslow Dfast : Drift n) (thr : ℝ) (hthr : 0 < thr) (c₀ : Abund n) (T : ℕ)
    (hsub : ∀ t < T, ∀ i ∈ support (evolve Dslow thr t c₀),
              thr ≤ Dslow.apply (evolve Dslow thr t c₀) i)
    (hsuper : ∃ t < T, ∃ i ∈ support (evolve Dfast thr t c₀),
              Dfast.apply (evolve Dfast thr t c₀) i < thr) :
    richness (evolve Dfast thr T c₀) < richness (evolve Dslow thr T c₀) := by
  obtain ⟨t, ht, i, halive, hpush⟩ := hsuper
  have hfast : support (evolve Dfast thr T c₀) ⊂ support c₀ :=
    fast_collapse Dfast thr c₀ T t i ht halive hpush
  have hslow : support (evolve Dslow thr T c₀) = support c₀ :=

  exact wu_wei_dominance Dslow Dfast thr c₀ T hslow hfast

===============================================================================
  REMAINING OBLIGATION (the input, deliberately not formalized):

    Discharge `hsub` / `hsuper` from `r_int` vs `r_eco` via the escape law
        MFPT(r_int) ≍ exp( ΔU(r_eco − r_int) / σ² ),   σ² ∝ 1/N,
    with critical rate `r*` solving  ΔU(r_eco − r*) = σ² · log(horizon).
    This is a Freidlin–Wentzell large-deviations estimate for the Wright–Fisher
    generator near the absorbing boundary; Mathlib does not yet contain the
    machinery.  Everything in this file is downstream of that law and is proven.
